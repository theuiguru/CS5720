 * The worker placing the item and the driver picking up the item. But 2 checks need to be in place.
 * 1. You can't put more than 20 items on the Conveyer, so worker needs to check that before placing another item on the conveyer. If 20 items are on conveyer, then sleep for 10 seconds until the driver has time to take more items off.
