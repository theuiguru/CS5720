 * MidtermServer.java (Main program): The server is running at “localhost”, connecting to the RSS news feed items to send it
 * 		           through the vendor, shared queue, and broadcaster, and finally broadcasting it out to the client.
 * Buffer.java: Set and get the total packaged for the broadcaster to send out to the customer.
 * NewsQueue.java: Two fetching data threads are working synchronously with the one that is taking data out from the queue. For 	 *		   simplicity, the queue can store only ONE news data item at any given time.
 * Vendor.java: Two threads working on fetching RSS data and put data in a shared queue.
